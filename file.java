// The differences between Java (*.java) and JavaScript (*.js) are extensive

// Instead of looking for the differences, just ignore the poor naming strategy
// and treat them as two random languages that have little in common to warrant
// such misleadingly similar names.

// Note that while vanilla JavaScript does not support classes, instead having
// prototype-based inheritance, Static TypeScript (STS), used in Makecode for the 
// micro:bit, does support classes, which syntactically are closer to Java than
// JavaScript. How they are supported internally is another matter altogether.
